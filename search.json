    "text": "A logic problem for LLMs\n\nRead the following and see if you can answer the question:\n\n\nThe Stolen Key (created by GPT 4o)\n\nFour friends‚ÄîAlex, Ben, Cara, and Dana‚Äîwere the only people in a locked house when the front door key went missing. Each of them made a statement:\n\nAlex: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt take the key.‚Äù\n\nBen: ‚ÄúCara took the key.‚Äù\n\nCara: ‚ÄúDana is lying.‚Äù\n\nDana: ‚ÄúBen is lying.‚Äù\n\nOnly one of them is telling the truth. Who stole the key?\n\n\nHow do LLMs response to the prompt?\n\nGPT4o\nLet‚Äôs analyze the statements logically:\n\nOnly one person is telling the truth.\nIf Ben were telling the truth (‚ÄúCara took the key‚Äù), then all other statements must be false.\n\nAlex saying ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt take the key‚Äù would be false ‚Üí meaning Alex did take the key. This contradicts Ben‚Äôs claim.\nTherefore, Ben is lying.\n\n\nSince Ben is lying, Cara did not take the key. That means we must find another truth-teller.\n\nIf Cara were telling the truth (‚ÄúDana is lying‚Äù), then:\n\nDana saying ‚ÄúBen is lying‚Äù would be false, meaning Ben is telling the truth.\nBut we already established that Ben was lying, so this contradicts our assumption.\n\n\nSince Cara cannot be the truth-teller either, let‚Äôs check Dana.\n\nIf Dana were telling the truth (‚ÄúBen is lying‚Äù), then:\n\nBen‚Äôs statement (‚ÄúCara took the key‚Äù) is false ‚Üí meaning Cara did NOT take the key.\nThat makes Alex‚Äôs statement (‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt take the key‚Äù) false ‚Üí meaning Alex DID take the key.\n\n\nSince this setup is consistent and only one truth-teller exists, the key was stolen by Alex.\n\n\nGPT4o1\nAnswer: Alex took the key.\nHere‚Äôs a quick way to see why:\n\nAssume Dana is telling the truth (‚ÄúBen is lying‚Äù).\nIf Ben is lying, then ‚ÄúCara took the key‚Äù is false, so Cara did not take the key.\nBecause only one statement can be true, Alex‚Äôs and Cara‚Äôs statements must be false:\n\nAlex‚Äôs statement ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt take the key‚Äù is false, so Alex did take the key.\nCara‚Äôs statement ‚ÄúDana is lying‚Äù is false, meaning Dana is indeed telling the truth.\n\n\nAll conditions are satisfied with Dana telling the truth and Alex as the thief.\n\n\nAnalysis of LLM Reasoning\nThis problem is an example of how LLMs process logical constraints. Given the one-truth constraint, LLMs systematically eliminate contradictions to arrive at a valid solution.\nNotably, both GPT-4o and GPT-4o1 reached the same answer through slightly different reasoning:\nGPT-4o used a step-by-step contradiction approach, testing each individual‚Äôs truthfulness and discarding inconsistencies. GPT-4o1 opted for a more streamlined deduction, assuming Dana‚Äôs truthfulness and resolving the logical consequences. This exercise highlights LLMs‚Äô ability to process deductive logic, truth-value constraints, and contradictions, making them effective at solving structured reasoning puzzles.\nWould another LLM produce the same answer? Would performance change if the statements were reworded? Testing across different models could reveal nuances in AI logical reasoning and bias towards specific deduction styles.\nWhat do you think‚Äîshould we test other AI models on this problem?"
