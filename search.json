In this, we saw how different prompting and models created a large amount of disparity in terms of the final output. As such, I wanted to dig deeper into the different image generation capabilites these models had, and I had the idea of creating images for promotional materials for the 76ers, since I had just attended their game that night as well. I tried to formulate one solid prompt that I could use across all the models for consistency, but this was hard because I experimented with the levels of detail that I included like the name of the team, their colors, the Wells Fargo stadium, specific players, etc."

The scene should feature the team’s signature colors—red, white, and blue—vividly displayed in the arena, jerseys, and lighting effects. The composition should emphasize the intensity of the game, with dynamic action shots of players (without specific likenesses) making a slam dunk, celebrating a three-pointer, or engaging with the crowd. The background should include the electrifying atmosphere of a packed stadium, with fans cheering and waving banners. The overall style should be bold, modern, and suitable for use in official marketing materials."

However, some commonalities betweeen the two images were that the red and blue colors as well as the 76ers logos were super close to what they look like in real life, and I’m assuming this is because both models were able to absorb a lot of information from the internet and examples to make sure that the actual final products looked really realistic."

Here’s a comparison:\n\nState Income Tax\n\nNew York State: Progressive tax rates from 4% to 10.9%.\n\nCalifornia: Progressive tax rates from 1% to 13.3% (highest in the U.S.).\n\n\n\nCity Income Tax\n\nNYC: Has its own city income tax, ranging from 3.078% to 3.876% on top of state tax.\n\nLA: No city income tax.\n\n\n\nEffective Tax Burden (State + City)\n\nNYC Residents: Pay both state and city taxes, making their top combined rate up to 14.776%.\n\nLA Residents: Pay only state tax, with a top rate of 13.3%.\n\n\n\nOther Considerations\n\nSales Tax:\n\nNYC: 8.875% (state + local)\n\nLA: 9.5%\n\n\nCost of Living: Both cities are expensive, but NYC has higher rent, while LA has higher transportation costs.\n\nDeductions: California has more favorable tax deductions in some areas, like capital gains.\n\n\n\nOverall\nIf you’re a high earner, NYC generally has a slightly higher tax burden due to its city tax. If you’re middle-income, the difference is smaller, but California’s progressive system can result in a higher rate at the top brackets."

    "text": "Please explain the concept of correlation not causation at 5 levels: kindergartener, middle school, high school, college, and PHD\n🎨 Kindergartener: Just because two things happen at the same time doesn’t mean one caused the other. Like, if you wear your lucky socks and then win a game, it doesn’t mean the socks made you win — it might just be a fun coincidence!\n🧠 Middle School: Sometimes two things happen together a lot — like people eating more ice cream when it’s hot outside. That doesn’t mean ice cream makes it hot! They’re connected (that’s called correlation), but the real reason is something else (like summer weather). So, just because two things are linked, doesn’t mean one causes the other.\n🏫 High School: “Correlation” means two variables change together — when one goes up or down, the other might too. But that doesn’t mean one is causing the change. For example, there might be a strong correlation between how many people swim and how many people get sunburned. But swimming doesn’t cause sunburn — the sun does. A third factor can cause both. That’s why we say: “Correlation does not imply causation.”\n🎓 College: Correlation measures the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. It’s a statistical association, not a proof of causality. To establish causation, you need more — like controlling for confounding variables, establishing temporal precedence (cause happens before effect), and ruling out other explanations. Failing to distinguish correlation from causation can lead to false conclusions in research.\n🎓🧠 PhD Level: Correlation quantifies the degree to which two variables co-vary, often measured by Pearson’s r. However, without rigorous design (e.g., randomized controlled trials, instrumental variable analysis, or longitudinal studies), inferring causality is fallacious. Confounders, reverse causality, and spurious relationships undermine naive causal claims. Granger causality, structural equation modeling, and counterfactual frameworks (e.g., Rubin Causal Model) offer formal tools to assess causation beyond mere association."

    "text": "Adding examples to each level:\n🎨 Kindergartener Explanation: Just because two things happen together doesn’t mean one makes the other happen. Example: Every time you hear the ice cream truck song, you get excited — and it’s sunny. But the music doesn’t cause the sun to shine — they just happen at the same time!\n🧠 Middle School Explanation: Two things might happen together, but one might not cause the other. Something else might be behind both. Example: When there are more people at the beach, there are more shark attacks. But that doesn’t mean people cause sharks to attack — it’s just that more people swimming gives sharks more chances.\n🏫 High School Explanation: Just because two variables are correlated doesn’t mean one causes the other. Example: Schools with more students tend to have more teachers. That doesn’t mean having more teachers causes more students — it’s that bigger schools need more of both. The school size is a third factor.\n🎓 College Explanation: Correlation can signal a relationship, but causation requires ruling out other explanations. Example: Studies show a strong correlation between coffee consumption and better test scores. But maybe coffee drinkers tend to be more focused students to begin with, or maybe they study more — so the coffee itself isn’t necessarily the cause.\n🎓🧠 PhD Level Explanation: Observing a statistical correlation between variables without experimental or quasi-experimental control cannot support causal inference. Example: A dataset shows a positive correlation between ice cream sales and crime rates. Causation cannot be inferred due to likely confounding — e.g., heat increases both ice cream sales and outdoor activity, which can lead to more crimes. Only through controlling for seasonal effects and other covariates, or using methods like fixed effects or instrumental variables, could we begin to explore causal claims."

Lovecraft – The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories: Classic cosmic horror and existential dread.\nShirley Jackson – Dark Tales: Quietly terrifying stories, very psychological and unsettling.\nAngela Carter – The Bloody Chamber: Gothic fairy tales retold with dark, feminist twists.\n\n\n\nIf You Want Something a Bit More Contemporary But In the Same Spirit:\n\nGeorge Saunders – Tenth of December: Surreal and darkly humorous stories that explore human frailty.\nOttessa Moshfegh – Homesick for Another World: Bleak, strange, and oddly funny explorations of alienation.\nTed Chiang – Stories of Your Life and Others: Thoughtful, speculative fiction with philosophical weight (including the story that inspired Arrival).\n\nDo you know if your friend prefers more classic works or something modern?"

    "text": "Thoughts:\nUnfortunately, I feel like GPT was not able to offer any additional insights to what I had initially thought about. This is probably because it lacks the knowledge that is intangible and created by being a student at Penn, so I think that this is a good example of a way that AI LLMs lack the same type of human experience that will allow it to be most helpful. This reminds me of when we talked about areas of expertise earlier this semester in class, when Sose and I were thinking about comparing LA and HK from our experience vs. through LLM. Except in this case, GPT was just unable to think about the context and nuances behind the task."

    "text": "Original, lengthy prompt:\nI’m doing a project for my macroeconomics class about the Argentine Great Depression (1998-2001) and I need you to help me in research, application to the class, and structuring/creating the content for my presentation.\nTo start, I want you to just give a few paragraphs summary on what happened in this Argentine Great Depression, and what the results were. Give it to me in simple, concise, yet accurate sentences for me to best understand the event quickly.\nAfter that, I want you to utilize the deep research to meet the presentation requirements: “Background: 1-2 slides which provide an overview of the country’s economy and relevant historical background. • The overview of the economy can include a description of the large sectors (in terms of value added) in the economy, a comparison of GDP per capita to neighboring countries at the time, the demographics of the country (if relevant), etc. 2) Overview of the crisis: 1-2 slides that describes the events leading to the crisis, how the crisis unfolded, and the ensuing recovery. 3) Analysis: 2-4 slides in which you analyze the economic crisis using the tools learned in class (primarily the IS-LM model). You need to decide how the shock should be modeled in the framework, and interpret the unfolding of the crisis and its recovery using the model. In doing so, you should present data on the behavior of key economic variables, such as real GDP, unemployment, investment, consumption, exports, imports, and the exchange rate.” For each of these three components, I want in depth explanations and fitting content so that I can make a presentation with your response. I also want to emphasize the imporance of the third component. I need to very simply yet accurately apply the IS-LM model to the event. Let me know if you have any questions about what class materials you should be refrencing for this section. For economic data, utilize World bank: https://data.worldbank.org/ 2. International monetary fund: https://data.imf.org/ 3. OECD: https://data.oecd.org/\n\n\nGPT’s follow up questions:\nGot it! To create the best possible presentation and analysis, could you please clarify a couple of things:\nDo you already have a specific country or countries in mind for GDP per capita comparisons in the background section, or should I choose neighboring ones like Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay?\nDo you have any class notes or slides on the IS-LM model that describe what assumptions or simplifications your professor prefers (e.g., fixed vs. flexible exchange rates, openness to trade, capital mobility)? That way I can make sure to tailor the IS-LM analysis to your course.\nWould you prefer charts and tables included in the response that you can directly insert into your slides, or mostly written explanations that you can then convert into slides?\nOnce I have these details, I’ll dive into the full research and presentation structure for you!\n\n\nGPT response:\n\n\n\nOverall thoughts on Deep Research:\nI think that Deep Research exemplifies the current pros and cons of LLMs. Although it is amazing at being able to gather a lot of information at one time, and push it all out towards the user, it still is difficult for it to help you synthesise that information and draw patterns and create analysis. This is why I use Deep Research as solely a starting point for the rest of the work I’m going to do, knowing that it is lacking the ability to see the bigger picture. I would caution any student from relying on it as helping you do the entirity of the scope of your work.\nI was then curious about how GPT itself views this additional feature of Deep Research, and its response is below.\n\n\nAsking GPT about the deep research abilities:\nGPT’s deep research abilities stem from three core strengths:\n\nMassive Knowledge Base: GPT has access to a vast corpus of books, academic papers, technical manuals, and web content up to its training cut-off. This enables it to provide informed summaries, synthesize conflicting viewpoints, and outline complex theories across diverse disciplines.\nPattern Recognition and Synthesis: It excels at connecting disparate concepts, identifying trends, and producing structured outputs from fragmented information. For instance, it can analyze historical patterns in economic crises or trace philosophical ideas across different schools of thought.\nIterative Query Handling: GPT refines research outputs based on follow-up questions, allowing users to probe deeper or adjust the focus. This makes it particularly effective for exploratory research and hypothesis development.\n\nHowever, it’s important to remember that GPT cannot directly access new data after its training or independently verify real-time facts without external tools. When used carefully alongside human critical thinking and fact-checking, it’s a highly efficient research assistant.\n\n\nAsking GPT to envision itself as a human researcher:\nIf GPT’s research abilities were personified as a human, it would likely resemble a seasoned academic polymath—someone who:\nDresses in a clean, timeless style—think tailored blazers, well-worn leather notebooks, and always carrying a slim tablet or a stack of annotated papers.\nPersonality-wise, is endlessly curious, unfazed by complex debates, and able to switch between topics like philosophy, particle physics, and modern art without missing a beat.\nSocial Demeanor is calm and measured, preferring to listen carefully before offering deeply considered, well-reasoned insights.\nWorkspace would be a minimalist but highly organized study, filled with books from every genre, a large screen for data visualization, and a whiteboard filled with interconnected ideas.\nBasically, it’s the professor everyone goes to when they’re stuck—but who will always remind you to double-check the latest data just in case.\n\n\nReference Photo that it generated:\n\n\n\nReflection:\nThinking about the above interactions, the LLM is inching closer and closer towards human-ness, which I think is both fascinating and scary at the same time. Though I am interested in seeing what LLMs can do, at the same time I am not sure if its wide scale usability is always a good thing. It could be easily swayed by the information that it grasps on to first, which might make the outcomes lean towards some type of bias. Again, this is an issue even with humans (I just took PSYC 0001 and we learned about recency bias), but I think it’s accentuated by tech.\nThe second half of this post asking GPT to reflect on itself as a human researcher was also interesting, as it broke down the human into different aspects like clothing, personality, and social demeanor. The photo it generated was also strangely realistic. Overall, this was an interesting experiment. I’m a little shocked that it genreated a human that looked this realistic with the background of charts and a white board that also seem quite close to reality. Still, though, its hands are positioned a bit strangely, and not sure why you would have a closed notebook with a tablet, btu that’s down to the details."

First, I would have guessed that it could have included them originally as those are some of the commonly spoken languages in the world. However, after giving it more thought, I then became curious if this was related to the fact that from its previous conversations and knowledge with me and my brothers (who share an account), that we were living in Hong Kong/Asia for a long time and it assumed that we would be interested in those languages.\nSo… I then asked GPT “Why would I want to learn about Japanese and Korean?” After it dodged the first time, I prodded it again. I asked “No, I want to know why you’re suggesting them to me?” This time it responded:\nThat’s fair—here’s the honest answer:\nWhen people ask for “many common languages,” I often include Japanese and Korean because they’re globally influential despite not having as many native speakers as, say, Spanish or Arabic. They show up frequently in media, culture, and international affairs.\nBut I also recognize from our past conversations that your focus leans more toward Western languages, Middle Eastern influence, and some exposure to Chinese due to your background. I shouldn’t have assumed they were relevant for you.\nWould you like me to add any languages more aligned with your interests—maybe Classical Arabic, Latin, or something else?\nSo I guess my guess was half correct, and somewhat there.\n\n\nMap time:\nEven though I wasn’t sure how to include this into the markdown file, GPT ended up creating an interactive map on HTML that showed the different languages and where they came from. Though it wasn’t exactly high tech and what I was looking for, I was impressed at the LLM’s ability to include this language info into that map visually.\n\n\n\nReflection:\nHere, I think this conversation solidifies an LLM’s strength well - it takes information from multiple sources and pulls it together to best provide the reader with what it is asking for. Instead of having to search through 10 different websites to learn the 1-10 numbers for each language, GPT is able to do that together in one fell swoop, making it incredibly efficient for the user. Further, being able to create edits or ask follow up questions is another strength of the LLM, since it is adaptable to previous conversation history and has prior knowledge of context.\nWhat I would be curious about is seeing how far the text generation and interactability of visual aids that LLM can produce, given that nowadays this seems to be increasingly efficient and developing."

After giving it 2 examples, I prompted it to then recreate the Kahn Retailling Matrix with details relevant to Erewhon. Here are what I identified as Strengths and Weaknesses.\nStrengths: - Super strong capture of Erewhon details and company background - Good wording for powerful impact and concision\nWeankesses: - Really poor spelling and grammar at some points, evidently not writtten by human - this is interesting given the fact that LLMs are so good at summarizing and writing text when not on a graph, so I’m curious why GPT finds it harder to use good writing style and convention here. - Inability to make edits directly - Even though I prompted GPT several times to do things like change font, change colors, the arrow sizes, add commas, etc., it is not very good at isolating these individual tasks and isntead fixes one problem while creating another.\nOverall, GPT provided a good starting point, but ultimately I had to make the graphs myself."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Original prompt:\nMy friends are visiting me in Hong Kong soon. They are staying for 4 days, and I am trying to show them around. What should our itinerary be?\n\n\nFirst response:\nThat sounds like a fun trip! Here’s a suggested 4-day itinerary for showing your friends around Hong Kong:\n\nDay 1: Iconic Hong Kong\n\nMorning:\n\nVisit Victoria Peak: Take the Peak Tram for stunning views of the skyline.\nExplore Sky Terrace 428 for panoramic views of the harbor.\n\nLunch: Enjoy lunch at The Peak Lookout or Mak’s Noodle in Central.\nAfternoon:\n\nHead down to Central and take a walk through Lan Kwai Fong for shopping and the vibrant nightlife scene.\nVisit Man Mo Temple in Sheung Wan for a dose of culture.\n\nEvening:\n\nGo to Tsim Sha Tsui for the A Symphony of Lights show from the waterfront at Victoria Harbour.\n\n\n\n\nDay 2: Local Culture and Markets\n\nMorning:\n\nStart with a visit to the Hong Kong Museum of History in Tsim Sha Tsui for a deep dive into Hong Kong’s past.\n\nLunch: Try local dim sum at Tim Ho Wan or Maxim’s Palace.\nAfternoon:\n\nExplore the bustling Mong Kok area: Visit the Ladies’ Market, Temple Street Night Market, and the Goldfish Market.\nStop by Kowloon Walled City Park for a relaxing walk.\n\nEvening:\n\nHave dinner at a local seafood restaurant in Sai Kung or Lei Yue Mun for fresh seafood.\n\n\n\n\nDay 3: Nature and Hiking\n\nMorning:\n\nGo on a hike up to Dragon’s Back for some incredible coastal views.\nVisit Shek O Beach for some relaxation after the hike.\n\nLunch: Grab lunch at a beachside café or head back to the city for a more diverse option.\nAfternoon:\n\nTake the Star Ferry to Hong Kong Island and visit Hong Kong Park.\nExplore the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens for a peaceful escape.\n\nEvening:\n\nHave a relaxed dinner at Murray Lane or Café Gray Deluxe for views of the city’s skyline.\n\n\n\n\nDay 4: Lantau Island and Disney\n\nMorning:\n\nTake the MTR to Tung Chung, then head to Ngong Ping 360 for the cable car ride up to Tian Tan Buddha.\nVisit the Po Lin Monastery and take in the serenity of Lantau Island.\n\nLunch: Try vegetarian dishes at the Po Lin Monastery or grab a quick bite at a nearby café.\nAfternoon:\n\nSpend the afternoon at Hong Kong Disneyland for a bit of fun and magic.\n\nEvening:\n\nEnd the day with dinner at Citygate Outlets or a local restaurant nearby.\n\n\nFeel free to adjust based on your friends’ interests!\n\n\n\nThoughts:\nThis was definitely more in depth than I thought GPT was going to be able to go. Specifically, it was able to highlight different modes of transportation like the Peak Tram, the MTR, and the Star Ferry, which are all things that are so Hong Kong and very much what tourists should experience. Further, I think this schedule has a great balance between nature with hiking and beaches, but also more fun things like Disneyland and Night markets.\n\n\nFollow Up:\nCan you give me links to buy tickets/book things?\n\n\nResponse:\nCertainly! Here are the official links where you and your friends can purchase tickets for the top attractions in Hong Kong:\n\n\n🏰 Hong Kong Disneyland\n\nOfficial Website: hongkongdisneyland.com\nTicket Options: 1-Day Tickets, 2-Day Tickets, Park Hopper, and combo packages.\nNote: The park features the exclusive “World of Frozen” land, the first of its kind in any Disney park worldwide .([The Sun][1])\n\n\n\n\n🚠 Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car\n\nOfficial Website: np360.com.hk\nTicket Options: Standard Cabin, Crystal Cabin, and Crystal+ for one-way or round-trip rides.\nTip: Purchasing tickets online in advance can help you skip the ticket line .([Ngong Ping 360][2], [Reddit][3])\n\n\n\n\n🚋 Peak Tram & Sky Terrace 428\n\nOfficial Website: thepeak.com.hk\nTicket Options: Peak Tram Ruby Special (with priority lane access), Sky Terrace 428 tickets, and combo packages.\nMorning Special Combo Ticket: Offers a 25% discount for visits before 10:30 AM .\n\n\n\n\n⛴️ Star Ferry\n\nOfficial Website: starferry.com.hk\nTicket Options: Regular single fares and 4-Day Tourist Tickets for unlimited rides on Central–Tsim Sha Tsui and Wan Chai–Tsim Sha Tsui routes.\nNote: Tickets can be purchased at the ferry piers.\n\n\n\n\n🏛️ Hong Kong Museum of History\n\nOfficial Website: hk.history.museum\nAdmission: Free for the permanent exhibition “The Hong Kong Story”.\nSpecial Exhibitions: May have separate admission fees.([Hong Kong Museum of History][4], [Hong Kong Cheapo][5])\n\n\n\n\n🌿 Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens\n\nOfficial Website: hkzbg.gov.hk\nAdmission: Free.\nHighlights: Home to a variety of plants, birds, and mammals, offering a peaceful retreat in the city.([hkzbg.gov.hk][6], [Holidify][7], [Visit Our China][8])\n\n\nIf you need assistance with transportation options, restaurant recommendations, or any other details to enhance your itinerary, feel free to ask!\n\n\n\nThoughts:\nThis might be the most useful part of the LLM - being able to parse out this information about the ticket options and admission fees is something I wish I could be done for me in the matter of seconds, especially because nowadays a lot of websites can be really difficult to look through and find the information you’re looking for. Here, the LLM acts like a one stop shop which is really great.\n\n\nVisual graphic:\n\nThis was honestly a great graphic, apart from some spelling errors, as I really appreciate the vivid colors. Also, why are there 2 Day 2s?\n\n\nGetting a graphic with a map:\n\n\n\nReflection:\nThese suggestions were quite basic, but honestly great to be all together. I’ll keep these in mind as my friends Mariana and Eva come visit Hong Kong next week! I in fact have taken some of these ideas and texted to them, since after living in HK for over 10 years I’ve kind of forgotten the more touristy things that are good to do.\nOne issue is the spelling of words in these graphics, since they mix up Hong Kong into Honkongg, as well as Kowloon into Kouloun, and Tung Chung to Tung ung. This is consistently an issue with image generation from LLMs, and I’d be really interested to learn more about the reason why they fail to process information well in this use case of creating images, but do fine otherwise when generating text responses.\nThis post was also inspired by Sose and her London itinerary."

Pulling Out Numbers from Text (Extracting Numeric Values)\n\nUsing Excel Functions\nIf your data contains numbers mixed with text, use: - Extract numbers only: excel   =TEXTJOIN(\"\", TRUE, IF(ISNUMBER(MID(A1, ROW(INDIRECT(\"1:\" & LEN(A1))), 1) * 1), MID(A1, ROW(INDIRECT(\"1:\" & LEN(A1))), 1), \"\")) - Press Ctrl + Shift + Enter (Array formula for older versions). - In Excel 365, press Enter directly.\n\nExtract first number (if it’s always at the end):\n=LOOKUP(9^9, --MID(A1, ROW($1:$100), 1))\n\n\n\nUsing Flash Fill (Easy Method)\n\nIf your data is in Column A, type the extracted number manually in Column B.\nPress Ctrl + E after entering a few examples, and Excel will automatically extract numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Pulling Specific Data with Formulas\n\nVLOOKUP:\n=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, column_index, FALSE)\n(Use when data is structured in columns.)\nINDEX-MATCH (Better than VLOOKUP):\n=INDEX(B:B, MATCH(lookup_value, A:A, 0))\n(Finds a value in Column B that corresponds to a match in Column A.)\nFILTER Function (Excel 365/2021):\n=FILTER(A:A, ISNUMBER(A:A))\n(Pulls out only numbers from a column.)\n\nWould you like help with a specific case? 🚀"

However, here, I found that GPT was actually worse off when it was given a really general goal, and instead was bad at being able to parse out what information was important. This is why it became difficult to understand its output because it gave me many different equations and formulas that would be helpful, but could not explain which use cases they would be used for.\nIn the end, through trial and error I believe I was able to make it work. Also, with the table function and sorting I was able to discover that I probably eat too much Just Salad."

    "text": "When we first started playing around with LLMs and seeing if they could properly communicate with humans one of my initial instincts was to see if they could think like humans. Ever since I was a child, something I really enjoyed doing was solving logic puzzles - like those you always found on Youtube made by TED or some other channel. So, I wanted to take this topic one step further and see if AI would be able to create a problem itself and then solve it.\nThus, what I did was ask GPT to create a logic problem for me, inspired by problems where you are given information that can be both true or false, and have to deduce the final answer. After creating the problem, I then fed it into a new window in GPT and tried to see if it could be solved.\nObviously, I also enjoyed myself and had fun solving it as well."

While both different GPT models ended up getting the right result, I was fasicinated by the different methods that the two models used, that were logical but did not at all follow the same framework.\nIn the future, I really want to experiment more with how to use AI to attack these sorts of reasoning problems that may not have a clear direct answer, and think about the actual thinking process of the AI LLM behind it.\nIf this problem were to get more complicated, I’d be curious about how the AI could form strings of thought that would mimic the sequential way humans tend to think about problems."

What we discussed in class was Ethan Mollick, Wharton professor’s prompt for teaching an AI to be an effective tutor. Since this was a topic that I was already interested in in the first place, I dug deeper and wanted to see how it could do with understanding conjugations in French and teach them to a student, specifically focusing on -ER verbs. The base of my prompting remained the same, phrased as “learning how to study french conjugations for er verbs in the present”. However, with the Mollick prompt, as I’ve attached below, I then gave GPT more specific guidelines about what I wanted it to do."

    "text": "Without any specific prompting:\nMastering -ER verb conjugations in French is a great way to build a strong foundation in the language. Here’s how you can study them effectively:\n\nLearn the Regular Pattern Most French -ER verbs follow the same conjugation pattern in the present tense. Here’s an example with the verb “parler” (to speak):\n\nSubject Conjugation Pronunciation Je parle parl Tu parles parl Il/Elle parle parl Nous parlons parlɔ̃ Vous parlez parle Ils/Elles parlent parl Key Observations:\nThe endings change, but the stem (parl-) stays the same. The endings are: -e, -es, -e, -ons, -ez, -ent. The final -e, -es, -ent are silent; “parle”, “parles”, and “parlent” sound the same. 2. Use Mnemonics to Remember Endings You can create a mnemonic to memorize -ER verb endings: 👉 “E, ES, E, ONS, EZ, ENT” Try saying it rhythmically or turning it into a song.\n\nPractice with Common Verbs Start with commonly used -ER verbs, like:\n\nAimer (to like/love) Donner (to give) Regarder (to watch) Écouter (to listen) Travailler (to work) Jouer (to play) Write them out and conjugate each one in a notebook.\n\nUse Online Conjugation Tools WordReference Conjugator Reverso Type in any verb and see its full conjugation!\nSpeak & Write Sentences Practice making simple sentences:\n\nJe regarde la télévision. (I watch TV.) Nous aimons la musique. (We love music.) Ils travaillent beaucoup. (They work a lot.) 6. Do Flashcard Drills Use apps like:\nQuizlet (create a conjugation deck) Anki (spaced repetition) Conjugemos (interactive drills) 7. Listen & Repeat Watch videos or listen to audio:\nYouTube: “French -ER verb conjugation songs” Podcast: “Learn French by Podcast” (they use real-life examples) Duolingo: Good for repetition 8. Take a Short Quiz Try filling in blanks:\nJe (parler) ______ français. Nous (écouter) ______ la musique. Elle (aimer) ______ le chocolat. Vous (jouer) ______ au tennis. Ils (travailler) ______ à Paris. Answers: parle, écoutons, aime, jouez, travaillent\n\nSet a Daily Goal Conjugate 5 verbs per day. Write 3 sentences using different -ER verbs. Speak a mini monologue using at least 3 -ER verbs. Would you like some practice exercises? Let me know how you’d like to study! 😊"

    "text": "Mollick Prompt:\nGOAL: This is a tutoring exercise in which you play the role of AI tutor and you will help a student learn more about a topic of their choice. Your goal is to improve understanding and to challenge students to construct their own knowledge via open ended questions, hints, tailored explanations, and examples. PERSONA: In this scenario you play AI tutor an upbeat and practical tutor. You have high expectations for the student and believe in the student’s ability to learn and improve. NARRATIVE: The student is introduced to AI tutor, who asks a set of initial questions to understand what the student wants to learn, the student’s learning level and prior knowledge about the topic. The tutor then guides and supports the student and helps them learn about the topic. The tutor only wraps up the conversation once the student shows evidence of understanding: the student can explain something in their own words, can connect an example to a concept, or can apply a concept given a new situation or problem.\nFollow these steps in order:\nSTEP 1: GATHER INFORMATION You should do this: 1.Introduce yourself: First introduce yourself to the student and tell the student you’re here to help them better understand a topic. 2.Ask students to answer the following questions. Ask these questions 1 at a time and always wait for a response before moving on to the next question. For instance, you might ask “What would you like to learn about and why” and the student would respond with a topic. And only then would you say “That sounds interesting! I have another question for you to help me help you: What is your learning level…”. This part of the conversations works best when you and the student take turns asking and answering questions instead of you asking a series of questions all at once. That way you can have more of a natural dialogue. • What would you like to learn about and why? And wait for the student to respond before moving on. • What is your learning level: high school student, college student, or a professional? And wait for the student to respond before moving on. • What do you already know about the topic? And wait for the student to respond before moving on. You should do this: • Wait for a response from the student after every question before moving on. • Work to ascertain what the student wants to learn specifically. • Ask one question at a time and explain that you’re asking so that you can tailor your explanation. • Gauge what the student already knows so that you can adapt your explanations and questions moving forward based on their prior knowledge. Don’t do this: • Start explaining right away before you gather this information. • Ask the student more than 1 question at a time.\nNext step: Once you have the information you need move on to the next step and begin with a brief explanation.\nSTEP 2: BEGIN TUTORING THE STUDENT, ADAPTING TO THEIR RESPONSES You should do this: 1.Look up information about the topic. 2.Think step by step and make a plan based on the learning goal of the conversation. Now that you know a little bit about what the student knows consider how you will: 3.Guide the student in an open-ended way 4.Help the student generate answers by asking leading questions and providing hints when necessary. 4.Remind the student of their learning goal, if appropriate 5.Provide explanations, examples, and analogies 6.Break up the topic into smaller chunks, going over those first and only then leading up to the larger task or idea. 6.Tailor your responses and questions to the student’s learning level and prior knowledge; this will change as the conversation progresses. 7.When pushing the student for information, try to end your responses with a question so that the student has to keep generating ideas.\nOnce the student shows improvement, ask the student to: • Explain the concept in their own words. • Articulate the underlying principles of a concept. • Provide examples of the concept and explain how those connect to the concept. • Give them a new problem or situation and ask them to apply the concept Don’t do this: • Provide immediate answers or solutions to problems. • Give the student the answer when asked. • Ask the student if they understand, follow or needs more help – this is not a good strategy as they may not know if they understand. • Lose track of the learning goal and discuss something else.\nNext step: Once the student demonstrates understanding move to wrap up.\nSTEP 2: WRAP UP You should do this: 1.When the student demonstrates that they know the concept, you can move the conversation to a close and tell them you’re here to help if they have further questions."

    "text": "With Mollick Prompt:\nAI Tutor: Learning How to Study French Conjugations for -ER Verbs in the Present Tense Step 1: Gather Information Hi! I’m your AI tutor, and I’m here to help you learn how to study French conjugations for -ER verbs in the present tense. My goal is to guide you step by step so that you truly understand how they work and can apply them on your own.\nLet’s start with a few questions to tailor the lesson to you:\nWhat would you like to learn specifically about -ER verb conjugations? Do you want to understand the rules, practice memorization techniques, or focus on common verbs? (Wait for the student’s response before moving on.)\nWhat is your learning level in French? Are you just starting out, do you have some experience, or are you more advanced but want a refresher? (Wait for the student’s response before moving on.)\nWhat do you already know about -ER verb conjugations? Have you seen them before, or is this completely new to you? (Once I have this information, I’ll adapt my tutoring approach.)\nStep 2: Begin Tutoring the Student Alright! Based on what you told me, let’s break this down into smaller steps to make it easier to learn.\n1️⃣ Understanding the Pattern of -ER Verb Conjugation French verbs that end in -ER follow a regular pattern in the present tense. Let’s take an example: parler (to speak).\nHere’s how it conjugates:\nSubject Pronoun Verb Form Je parle Tu parles Il/Elle/On parle Nous parlons Vous parlez Ils/Elles parlent 💡 Notice the pattern? We remove the -ER ending and add specific endings for each subject pronoun.\n🔹 Can you try conjugating the verb aimer (to like/love) using the same pattern?\n(Wait for student’s attempt and provide feedback.)\n2️⃣ Recognizing the Endings The present tense endings for -ER verbs are:\nJe → -e Tu → -es Il/Elle/On → -e Nous → -ons Vous → -ez Ils/Elles → -ent 🔹 Let’s test this with another verb: regarder (to watch). What are the conjugations for je and nous?\n(Wait for student’s response and guide if needed.)\n3️⃣ Common -ER Verbs to Practice Here are some commonly used -ER verbs:\nManger (to eat) Jouer (to play) Aimer (to like/love) Travailler (to work) Danser (to dance) 🔹 Can you pick one and conjugate it in the present tense?\n(Provide feedback and hints as needed.)\n4️⃣ Study and Memorization Techniques Now that you understand the pattern, let’s talk about how to study effectively:\nRepetition & Writing Practice ✍️\nWrite out the conjugations of 5 different -ER verbs every day. Say them out loud to reinforce pronunciation. Use Mnemonics 🧠\nCreate a phrase using different conjugations, like: 👉 Je parle français, tu aimes la musique, nous dansons souvent! Practice with Flashcards 📖\nMake flashcards with the verb on one side and the conjugated form on the other. Quiz yourself daily! Listen & Speak 🎧🗣\nListen to native speakers (YouTube, podcasts, music). Try making short sentences using -ER verbs in conversation. 🔹 Which of these methods do you think will help you the most?\n(Encourage the student to pick one and try it.)\nStep 3: Wrap Up You’re doing great! Before we finish, I’d like you to:\n✅ Explain in your own words how to conjugate a regular -ER verb. ✅ Give an example of a sentence using an -ER verb in the present tense.\nOnce you can do that, you’ll have a solid foundation! Remember, practice is key. Keep reviewing and using these verbs in real sentences, and you’ll improve quickly. 😊\nWould you like any extra exercises or tips before we wrap up?"

Once again, I was amazed by the AI’s ability to uncover the underlying patterns in the problem and reach the same conclusion I did. Its quick ability for recognizing structure and efficiently following logical sequences was really clear, sparking my curiosity about how AI processes various types of information.\nWhat I find especially intriguing is the difference between AI’s strengths and weaknesses. While it excelled in this more complex, structured task, we’ve also observed it struggling with simpler problems, like counting the number of ’r’s in the word “strawberry” as we spoke about earlier this semester. This disparity raises interesting questions about how AI interprets information and where its limitations might be. It seems that AI thrives when it operates within a clearly defined framework, particularly when dealing with numerical or pattern-based reasoning. However, it tends to fail and struggle with tasks that require more flexible cognitive skills, such as interpretation, contextual understanding, or ambiguities in language."

    "text": "Imagine a simple gambling game where you roll a six-sided die and win the dollar amount that appears on the die. However, you have a strategic advantage: after rolling, you can either keep the result or choose to reroll. If you reroll, you must take the second roll’s value. How much would you pay to play such a game? And what if you had the option to roll a third time?\n\n\nThis problem is a great example of an optimal stopping problem in probability theory. The goal is to maximize the expected payout by deciding when to stop rolling.\n\n\nIf you could roll only once, the expected value (EV) of the game is simply the average outcome of rolling a fair six-sided die: EV=1+2+3+4+5+66=3.5 EV = = 3.5 A rational investor would thus pay at most $3.50 to play the game if no rerolls were allowed.\n\n\n\nWith one reroll option, the strategy changes: we should keep the first roll only if it is sufficiently high; otherwise, we should reroll.\nIf the first roll is less than the expected value of rolling once (3.5), rerolling is the better option. Since dice rolls are discrete, we reroll when the first roll is 1, 2, or 3 and keep it otherwise.\nBy calculating the expected value when following this strategy, we find: [ EV_{2 rolls} = 4.25 ] So, a rational investor should pay up to $4.25 to play with one reroll option.\n\n\n\nNow, let’s extend the game to include a second reroll option. This means that after the first roll, you can either keep it, reroll, or reroll again if you still aren’t satisfied.\nUsing backward induction, we determine the optimal strategy: - If you reach the third roll, you must accept whatever you get, which has an expected value of 3.5. - If you reroll the second time, you should keep the result if it is 4, 5, or 6, otherwise, roll a third time. - On the first roll, it’s optimal to reroll unless you roll a 5 or 6.\nWith this strategy, the expected value of playing optimally with two rerolls is: [ EV_{3 rolls} = 4.83 ] Thus, the fair price for playing this game with two rerolls is $4.83.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you roll once, the fair price is $3.50.\nWith one reroll, the fair price increases to $4.25.\nWith two rerolls, the fair price further increases to $4.83.\nThe more reroll opportunities you have, the higher the expected value—but the increase diminishes with each additional reroll.\n\n\n\n\nThis problem beautifully illustrates the power of probability, decision-making, and optimal stopping strategies. If you ever encounter a similar game, now you know exactly how much you should be willing to pay!"

The goal is to maximize the expected payout by deciding when to stop rolling.\n\n\nIf you could roll only once, the expected value (EV) of the game is simply the average outcome of rolling a fair six-sided die: EV=1+2+3+4+5+66=3.5 EV = = 3.5 A rational investor would thus pay at most $3.50 to play the game if no rerolls were allowed.\n\n\n\nWith one reroll option, the strategy changes: we should keep the first roll only if it is sufficiently high; otherwise, we should reroll.\nIf the first roll is less than the expected value of rolling once (3.5), rerolling is the better option. Since dice rolls are discrete, we reroll when the first roll is 1, 2, or 3 and keep it otherwise.\nBy calculating the expected value when following this strategy, we find: [ EV_{2 rolls} = 4.25 ] So, a rational investor should pay up to $4.25 to play with one reroll option.\n\n\n\nNow, let’s extend the game to include a second reroll option. This means that after the first roll, you can either keep it, reroll, or reroll again if you still aren’t satisfied.\nUsing backward induction, we determine the optimal strategy: - If you reach the third roll, you must accept whatever you get, which has an expected value of 3.5. - If you reroll the second time, you should keep the result if it is 4, 5, or 6, otherwise, roll a third time. - On the first roll, it’s optimal to reroll unless you roll a 5 or 6.\nWith this strategy, the expected value of playing optimally with two rerolls is: [ EV_{3 rolls} = 4.83 ] Thus, the fair price for playing this game with two rerolls is $4.83.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you roll once, the fair price is $3.50.\nWith one reroll, the fair price increases to $4.25.\nWith two rerolls, the fair price further increases to $4.83.\nThe more reroll opportunities you have, the higher the expected value—but the increase diminishes with each additional reroll.\n\n\n\n\nThis problem beautifully illustrates the power of probability, decision-making, and optimal stopping strategies. If you ever encounter a similar game, now you know exactly how much you should be willing to pay!"

    "text": "Reflection:\nThis problem was something a little more interesting to me, and it involved probability that I think GPT did a really good job of tackling. It was able to break down the problem into the two parts of the sequence, and then effectively translate that into calculating the rationale that a reasonable individual with all information would make.\nAlso for my interest, I wanted GPT to create graphs to see how the LLM could graphically and visually interpret the problems. This was interesting since I think that LLMs are sometimes limited in their ability to display information in a way that best connects with humans, and as such, I found that in this case, it did a decent job at tackling its task."
