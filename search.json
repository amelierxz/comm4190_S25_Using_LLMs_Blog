Once again, I was amazed by the AI‚Äôs ability to uncover the underlying patterns in the problem and reach the same conclusion I did. Its quick ability for recognizing structure and efficiently following logical sequences was really clear, sparking my curiosity about how AI processes various types of information.\nWhat I find especially intriguing is the difference between AI‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses. While it excelled in this more complex, structured task, we‚Äôve also observed it struggling with simpler problems, like counting the number of ‚Äôr‚Äôs in the word ‚Äústrawberry‚Äù as we spoke about earlier this semester. This disparity raises interesting questions about how AI interprets information and where its limitations might be. It seems that AI thrives when it operates within a clearly defined framework, particularly when dealing with numerical or pattern-based reasoning. However, it tends to fail and struggle with tasks that require more flexible cognitive skills, such as interpretation, contextual understanding, or ambiguities in language."

    "text": "When learning French or helping a student with their studies, AI tools like ChatGPT can be extremely useful. In this post, I‚Äôll walk you through how I used ChatGPT to clarify tricky French grammar‚Äîspecifically de, dela, des. This came from a real life application - last Sunday I was working with a Freshman in French 0200 Beginner‚Äôs French and trying to explain these grammar concepts when I decided to try out using Chat GPT.\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in learning French is mastering prepositions, articles, and small grammatical details that affect meaning. Recently, I asked ChatGPT to explain the differences between de, dela, and des, and the response gave me a clear, structured breakdown:\n\nDe ‚Üí ‚Äúof‚Äù or ‚Äúfrom‚Äù (possession, origin, general use)\n\nEx: Le livre de Marie. (Marie‚Äôs book.)\n\nEx: Je viens de Paris. (I come from Paris.)\n\nDela ‚Üí Rarely used today but historically meant ‚Äúbeyond‚Äù (de l√†). Now written separately.\n\nEx: Regarde de l√†! (Look from there!)\n\nDes ‚Üí ‚Äúof the‚Äù or ‚Äúsome‚Äù (plural of du/de la or contraction of de + les)\n\nEx: Les livres des √©tudiants. (The students‚Äô books.)\n\nEx: Je mange des pommes. (I eat some apples.)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen teaching, you can ask ChatGPT to explain a concept in simple terms, like I did.\n\nIf a student is confused, use AI to generate multiple examples for clarity.\n\nIf you‚Äôre self-studying, this method saves time compared to searching in textbooks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I asked ChatGPT to condense the explanation into a notecard-sized cheat sheet, it quickly summarized the essential points. This is a great way to:\n- Create quick reference guides for key grammar rules.\n- Simplify notes for tutoring sessions.\n- Help students focus on what‚Äôs most important instead of getting lost in details.\nüí° Tip: If you‚Äôre tutoring, ask ChatGPT to simplify explanations based on your student‚Äôs level (beginner, intermediate, advanced).\n\n\n\n\nBeyond this one example, you can use ChatGPT to improve both personal learning and tutoring sessions in multiple ways:\n\n\n\nAsk for differences between confusing words (‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between savoir and conna√Ætre?‚Äù).\n\nGet example sentences to show words in context.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk for phonetic transcriptions (‚ÄúHow do I pronounce ‚Äò≈ìuvre‚Äô?‚Äù).\n\nGet tips on common pronunciation mistakes in French.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate fill-in-the-blank exercises: ‚ÄúProvide a practice quiz for de, du, des.‚Äù\n\nGet short reading passages with comprehension questions.\n\nSimulate real-life conversations (‚ÄúPretend I‚Äôm at a French bakery ordering a croissant.‚Äù).\n\nUsing ChatGPT to learn French is like having an on-demand tutor‚Äîit‚Äôs fast, clear, and customizable. Whether you‚Äôre tackling tricky grammar like de, dela, des or creating teaching materials, this AI tool can make studying more efficient and interactive.\n\n\n\n\nAbove, I used GPT with the memory of me prompting it to help me teach a student in French with some prepositions to have it reflect on using GPT to learn languages. I think it did quite a good job of resonating with me and picking the right ideas, since I found that GPT was really good at providing basic information, but then would lack nuance when I asked for more examples. As such, I think that GPT as a tutor is only really useful for simple and beginner level topics, and gets less helpful as you become more advanced with a language.\n\n\n\nThinking about this blog post, I was talking to my groupmates Sose and Carlos and we were interested in seeing if using more training and priming we would be able to make a LLM specifically prepared for language tutoring, so I think this might be a tentative idea for our final project."

    "text": "A logic problem for LLMs\n\nRead the following and see if you can answer the question:\n\n\nThe Stolen Key (created by GPT 4o)\n\nFour friends‚ÄîAlex, Ben, Cara, and Dana‚Äîwere the only people in a locked house when the front door key went missing. Each of them made a statement:\n\nAlex: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt take the key.‚Äù\n\nBen: ‚ÄúCara took the key.‚Äù\n\nCara: ‚ÄúDana is lying.‚Äù\n\nDana: ‚ÄúBen is lying.‚Äù\n\nOnly one of them is telling the truth. Who stole the key?\n\n\nHow do LLMs response to the prompt?\n\nGPT4o\nLet‚Äôs analyze the statements logically:\n\nOnly one person is telling the truth.\nIf Ben were telling the truth (‚ÄúCara took the key‚Äù), then all other statements must be false.\n\nAlex saying ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt take the key‚Äù would be false ‚Üí meaning Alex did take the key. This contradicts Ben‚Äôs claim.\nTherefore, Ben is lying.\n\n\nSince Ben is lying, Cara did not take the key. That means we must find another truth-teller.\n\nIf Cara were telling the truth (‚ÄúDana is lying‚Äù), then:\n\nDana saying ‚ÄúBen is lying‚Äù would be false, meaning Ben is telling the truth.\nBut we already established that Ben was lying, so this contradicts our assumption.\n\n\nSince Cara cannot be the truth-teller either, let‚Äôs check Dana.\n\nIf Dana were telling the truth (‚ÄúBen is lying‚Äù), then:\n\nBen‚Äôs statement (‚ÄúCara took the key‚Äù) is false ‚Üí meaning Cara did NOT take the key.\nThat makes Alex‚Äôs statement (‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt take the key‚Äù) false ‚Üí meaning Alex DID take the key.\n\n\nSince this setup is consistent and only one truth-teller exists, the key was stolen by Alex.\n\n\nGPT4o1\nAnswer: Alex took the key.\nHere‚Äôs a quick way to see why:\n\nAssume Dana is telling the truth (‚ÄúBen is lying‚Äù).\nIf Ben is lying, then ‚ÄúCara took the key‚Äù is false, so Cara did not take the key.\nBecause only one statement can be true, Alex‚Äôs and Cara‚Äôs statements must be false:\n\nAlex‚Äôs statement ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt take the key‚Äù is false, so Alex did take the key.\nCara‚Äôs statement ‚ÄúDana is lying‚Äù is false, meaning Dana is indeed telling the truth.\n\n\nAll conditions are satisfied with Dana telling the truth and Alex as the thief.\n\n\nAnalysis of LLM Reasoning\nThis problem is an example of how LLMs process logical constraints. Given the one-truth constraint, LLMs systematically eliminate contradictions to arrive at a valid solution.\nNotably, both GPT-4o and GPT-4o1 reached the same answer through slightly different reasoning:\nGPT-4o used a step-by-step contradiction approach, testing each individual‚Äôs truthfulness and discarding inconsistencies. GPT-4o1 opted for a more streamlined deduction, assuming Dana‚Äôs truthfulness and resolving the logical consequences. This exercise highlights LLMs‚Äô ability to process deductive logic, truth-value constraints, and contradictions, making them effective at solving structured reasoning puzzles.\nWould another LLM produce the same answer? Would performance change if the statements were reworded? Testing across different models could reveal nuances in AI logical reasoning and bias towards specific deduction styles.\nWhat do you think‚Äîshould we test other AI models on this problem?\nI found this super interesting after trying to make this logic problem out of boredom - and attempting to capture how AI can think through a reasoning problem that humans typically attack in a non-linear fashion. While both different GPT models ended up getting the right result, I was fasicinated by the different methods that the two models used, that were logical but did not at all follow the same framework.\nIn the future, I really want to experiment more with how to use AI to attack these sorts of reasoning problems that may not have a clear direct answer, and think about the actual thinking process of the AI LLM behind it."

    "text": "Imagine a simple gambling game where you roll a six-sided die and win the dollar amount that appears on the die. However, you have a strategic advantage: after rolling, you can either keep the result or choose to reroll. If you reroll, you must take the second roll‚Äôs value. How much would you pay to play such a game? And what if you had the option to roll a third time?\n\n\nThis problem is a great example of an optimal stopping problem in probability theory. The goal is to maximize the expected payout by deciding when to stop rolling.\n\n\nIf you could roll only once, the expected value (EV) of the game is simply the average outcome of rolling a fair six-sided die: [ EV = = 3.5 ] A rational investor would thus pay at most $3.50 to play the game if no rerolls were allowed.\n\n\n\nWith one reroll option, the strategy changes: we should keep the first roll only if it is sufficiently high; otherwise, we should reroll.\nIf the first roll is less than the expected value of rolling once (3.5), rerolling is the better option. Since dice rolls are discrete, we reroll when the first roll is 1, 2, or 3 and keep it otherwise.\nBy calculating the expected value when following this strategy, we find: [ EV_{2¬†rolls} = 4.25 ] So, a rational investor should pay up to $4.25 to play with one reroll option.\n\n\n\nNow, let‚Äôs extend the game to include a second reroll option. This means that after the first roll, you can either keep it, reroll, or reroll again if you still aren‚Äôt satisfied.\nUsing backward induction, we determine the optimal strategy: - If you reach the third roll, you must accept whatever you get, which has an expected value of 3.5. - If you reroll the second time, you should keep the result if it is 4, 5, or 6, otherwise, roll a third time. - On the first roll, it‚Äôs optimal to reroll unless you roll a 5 or 6.\nWith this strategy, the expected value of playing optimally with two rerolls is: [ EV_{3¬†rolls} = 4.83 ] Thus, the fair price for playing this game with two rerolls is $4.83.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you roll once, the fair price is $3.50.\nWith one reroll, the fair price increases to $4.25.\nWith two rerolls, the fair price further increases to $4.83.\nThe more reroll opportunities you have, the higher the expected value‚Äîbut the increase diminishes with each additional reroll.\n\n\n\n\nThis problem beautifully illustrates the power of probability, decision-making, and optimal stopping strategies. If you ever encounter a similar game, now you know exactly how much you should be willing to pay!"

Organizing Data in Excel\n\nSorting & Filtering\n\nSort: Go to Data ‚Üí Sort to arrange numbers in ascending or descending order.\nFilter: Use Data ‚Üí Filter to show only specific values or conditions.\n\n\n\nUsing Tables for Better Organization\n\nSelect your data and press Ctrl + T to create a structured table.\nThis makes filtering, sorting, and referencing easier.\n\n\n\nRemoving Duplicates\n\nGo to Data ‚Üí Remove Duplicates to clean your dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Pulling Out Numbers from Text (Extracting Numeric Values)\n\nUsing Excel Functions\nIf your data contains numbers mixed with text, use: - Extract numbers only: excel   =TEXTJOIN(\"\", TRUE, IF(ISNUMBER(MID(A1, ROW(INDIRECT(\"1:\" & LEN(A1))), 1) * 1), MID(A1, ROW(INDIRECT(\"1:\" & LEN(A1))), 1), \"\")) - Press Ctrl + Shift + Enter (Array formula for older versions). - In Excel 365, press Enter directly.\n\nExtract first number (if it‚Äôs always at the end):\n=LOOKUP(9^9, --MID(A1, ROW($1:$100), 1))\n\n\n\nUsing Flash Fill (Easy Method)\n\nIf your data is in Column A, type the extracted number manually in Column B.\nPress Ctrl + E after entering a few examples, and Excel will automatically extract numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Pulling Specific Data with Formulas\n\nVLOOKUP:\n=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, column_index, FALSE)\n(Use when data is structured in columns.)\nINDEX-MATCH (Better than VLOOKUP):\n=INDEX(B:B, MATCH(lookup_value, A:A, 0))\n(Finds a value in Column B that corresponds to a match in Column A.)\nFILTER Function (Excel 365/2021):\n=FILTER(A:A, ISNUMBER(A:A))\n(Pulls out only numbers from a column.)\n\nWould you like help with a specific case? üöÄ"
