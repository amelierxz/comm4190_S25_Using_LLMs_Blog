    "New York City (NYC) and Los Angeles (LA) have different tax structures due to state and local tax policies. Here's a comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **State Income Tax**  \n",
    "- **New York State**: Progressive tax rates from **4% to 10.9%**.  \n",
    "- **California**: Progressive tax rates from **1% to 13.3%** (highest in the U.S.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **City Income Tax**  \n",
    "- **NYC**: Has its own city income tax, ranging from **3.078% to 3.876%** on top of state tax.  \n",
    "- **LA**: No city income tax.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Effective Tax Burden** (State + City)  \n",
    "- **NYC Residents**: Pay both state and city taxes, making their top combined rate **up to 14.776%**.  \n",
    "- **LA Residents**: Pay only state tax, with a top rate of **13.3%**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Other Considerations**  \n",
    "- **Sales Tax**:  \n",
    "  - NYC: **8.875%** (state + local)  \n",
    "  - LA: **9.5%**  \n",
    "- **Cost of Living**: Both cities are expensive, but NYC has higher rent, while LA has higher transportation costs.  \n",
    "- **Deductions**: California has more favorable tax deductions in some areas, like capital gains.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overall**  \n",
    "If you're a **high earner**, NYC generally has a slightly higher tax burden due to its city tax. If you're middle-income, the difference is smaller, but California's progressive system can result in a higher rate at the top brackets."
