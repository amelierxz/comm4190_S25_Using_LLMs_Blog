    "- **MGMT 3010** is project-based and time-intensive (teamwork simulations).\n",
    "- Combined with a **language-intensive** FREN 1226 and writing-heavy HIST 1190, this is a **challenging schedule**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, I feel like GPT was not able to offer any additional insights to what I had initially thought about. This is probably because it lacks the knowledge that is intangible and created by being a student at Penn, so I think that this is a good example of a way that AI LLMs lack the same type of human experience that will allow it to be most helpful. This reminds me of when we talked about areas of expertise earlier this semester in class, when Sose and I were thinking about comparing LA and HK from our experience vs. through LLM. Except in this case, GPT was just unable to think about the context and nuances behind the task."
