Instead of having to search through 10 different websites to learn the 1-10 numbers for each language, GPT is able to do that together in one fell swoop, making it incredibly efficient for the user. Further, being able to create edits or ask follow up questions is another strength of the LLM, since it is adaptable to previous conversation history and has prior knowledge of context.\n",
