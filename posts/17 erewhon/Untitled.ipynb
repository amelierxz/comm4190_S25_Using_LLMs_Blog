    "As I worked on this marketing presentation, I thought it would be interesting if Chat GPT would be able to take reference photos from our lecture slides and try to reconfigure them to fit Erewhon, which was the company we were doing our final keystone presentation on. After giving it 2 examples, I prompted it to then recreate the Kahn Retailling Matrix with details relevant to Erewhon. Here are what I identified as Strengths and Weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "- Super strong capture of Erewhon details and company background\n",
    "- Good wording for powerful impact and concision\n",
    "\n",
    "Weankesses:\n",
    "- Really poor spelling and grammar at some points, evidently not writtten by human - this is interesting given the fact that LLMs are so good at summarizing and writing text when not on a graph, so I'm curious why GPT finds it harder to use good writing style and convention here.\n",
    "- Inability to make edits directly - Even though I prompted GPT several times to do things like change font, change colors, the arrow sizes, add commas, etc., it is not very good at isolating these individual tasks and isntead fixes one problem while creating another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, GPT provided a good starting point, but ultimately I had to make the graphs myself."
