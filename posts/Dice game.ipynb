    "## The Optimal Dice Game: How Much Should You Pay to Play?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a simple gambling game where you roll a six-sided die and win the dollar amount that appears on the die. However, you have a strategic advantage: after rolling, you can either keep the result or choose to reroll. If you reroll, you must take the second roll’s value. How much would you pay to play such a game? And what if you had the option to roll a third time?"

    "### **GPT 4 response: Breaking Down the Strategy **\n",
    "This problem is a great example of an **optimal stopping problem** in probability theory. The goal is to maximize the expected payout by deciding when to stop rolling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: A Single Roll Without Rerolls**\n",
    "If you could roll only once, the expected value (EV) of the game is simply the average outcome of rolling a fair six-sided die:\n",
    "\\[ EV = \\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6} = 3.5 \\]\n",
    "A rational investor would thus pay at most **$3.50** to play the game if no rerolls were allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Adding One Reroll**\n",
    "With one reroll option, the strategy changes: we should keep the first roll only if it is sufficiently high; otherwise, we should reroll.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the first roll is **less than the expected value of rolling once (3.5)**, rerolling is the better option. Since dice rolls are discrete, we reroll when the first roll is **1, 2, or 3** and keep it otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "By calculating the expected value when following this strategy, we find:\n",
    "\\[ EV_{2\\ rolls} = 4.25 \\]\n",
    "So, a rational investor should pay up to **$4.25** to play with one reroll option.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Adding a Second Reroll**\n",
    "Now, let’s extend the game to include a **second reroll** option. This means that after the first roll, you can either keep it, reroll, or reroll again if you still aren't satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using backward induction, we determine the optimal strategy:\n",
    "- If you reach the third roll, you must accept whatever you get, which has an expected value of **3.5**.\n",
    "- If you reroll the second time, you should keep the result **if it is 4, 5, or 6**, otherwise, roll a third time.\n",
    "- On the first roll, it’s optimal to **reroll unless you roll a 5 or 6**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this strategy, the expected value of playing optimally with two rerolls is:\n",
    "\\[ EV_{3\\ rolls} = 4.83 \\]\n",
    "Thus, the fair price for playing this game with **two rerolls** is **$4.83**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "- If you **roll once**, the fair price is **$3.50**.\n",
    "- With **one reroll**, the fair price increases to **$4.25**.\n",
    "- With **two rerolls**, the fair price further increases to **$4.83**.\n",
    "- The more reroll opportunities you have, the higher the expected value—but the increase diminishes with each additional reroll.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "This problem beautifully illustrates the power of probability, decision-making, and optimal stopping strategies. If you ever encounter a similar game, now you know exactly how much you should be willing to pay!\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you take the bet? Let us know your thoughts!\n",
