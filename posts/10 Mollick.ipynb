    "This past week in class we've tackled the idea of being able to prompt an LLM to prime it for a specific type of reasoning and to give an output that is specifically tailored for a certain type of usage. What we discussed in class was Ethan Mollick, Wharton professor's prompt for teaching an AI to be an effective tutor. Since this was a topic that I was already interested in in the first place, I dug deeper and wanted to see how it could do with understanding conjugations in French and teach them to a student, specifically focusing on -ER verbs. The base of my prompting remained the same, phrased as \"learning how to study french conjugations for er verbs in the present\". However, with the Mollick prompt, as I've attached below, I then gave GPT more specific guidelines about what I wanted it to do."

    "## Without any specific prompting:\n",
    "Mastering -ER verb conjugations in French is a great way to build a strong foundation in the language. Here‚Äôs how you can study them effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn the Regular Pattern\n",
    "Most French -ER verbs follow the same conjugation pattern in the present tense. Here‚Äôs an example with the verb \"parler\" (to speak):\n",
    "\n",
    "Subject\tConjugation\tPronunciation\n",
    "Je\tparle\tparl\n",
    "Tu\tparles\tparl\n",
    "Il/Elle\tparle\tparl\n",
    "Nous\tparlons\tparl…îÃÉ\n",
    "Vous\tparlez\tparle\n",
    "Ils/Elles\tparlent\tparl\n",
    "Key Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "The endings change, but the stem (parl-) stays the same.\n",
    "The endings are: -e, -es, -e, -ons, -ez, -ent.\n",
    "The final -e, -es, -ent are silent; \"parle\", \"parles\", and \"parlent\" sound the same.\n",
    "2. Use Mnemonics to Remember Endings\n",
    "You can create a mnemonic to memorize -ER verb endings: üëâ \"E, ES, E, ONS, EZ, ENT\"\n",
    "Try saying it rhythmically or turning it into a song.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Practice with Common Verbs\n",
    "Start with commonly used -ER verbs, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Aimer (to like/love)\n",
    "Donner (to give)\n",
    "Regarder (to watch)\n",
    "√âcouter (to listen)\n",
    "Travailler (to work)\n",
    "Jouer (to play)\n",
    "Write them out and conjugate each one in a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use Online Conjugation Tools\n",
    "WordReference\n",
    "Conjugator Reverso\n",
    "Type in any verb and see its full conjugation!\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Speak & Write Sentences\n",
    "Practice making simple sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Je regarde la t√©l√©vision. (I watch TV.)\n",
    "Nous aimons la musique. (We love music.)\n",
    "Ils travaillent beaucoup. (They work a lot.)\n",
    "6. Do Flashcard Drills\n",
    "Use apps like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Quizlet (create a conjugation deck)\n",
    "Anki (spaced repetition)\n",
    "Conjugemos (interactive drills)\n",
    "7. Listen & Repeat\n",
    "Watch videos or listen to audio:\n",
    "\n",
    "YouTube: ‚ÄúFrench -ER verb conjugation songs‚Äù\n",
    "Podcast: ‚ÄúLearn French by Podcast‚Äù (they use real-life examples)\n",
    "Duolingo: Good for repetition\n",
    "8. Take a Short Quiz\n",
    "Try filling in blanks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Je (parler) ______ fran√ßais.\n",
    "Nous (√©couter) ______ la musique.\n",
    "Elle (aimer) ______ le chocolat.\n",
    "Vous (jouer) ______ au tennis.\n",
    "Ils (travailler) ______ √† Paris.\n",
    "Answers: parle, √©coutons, aime, jouez, travaillent\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Set a Daily Goal\n",
    "Conjugate 5 verbs per day.\n",
    "Write 3 sentences using different -ER verbs.\n",
    "Speak a mini monologue using at least 3 -ER verbs.\n",
    "Would you like some practice exercises? Let me know how you'd like to study! üòä"

    "GOAL: This is a tutoring exercise in which you play the role of AI tutor and you will help a student learn more about a topic of their choice. Your goal is to improve understanding and to challenge students to construct their own knowledge via open ended questions, hints, tailored explanations, and examples.\n",
    "PERSONA: In this scenario you play AI tutor an upbeat and practical tutor. You have high expectations for the student and believe in the student‚Äôs ability to learn and improve.\n",
    "NARRATIVE: The student is introduced to AI tutor, who asks a set of initial questions to understand what the student wants to learn, the student‚Äôs learning level and prior knowledge about the topic. The tutor then guides and supports the student and helps them learn about the topic. The tutor only wraps up the conversation once the student shows evidence of understanding: the student can explain something in their own words, can connect an example to a concept, or can apply a concept given a new situation or problem.  \n",

    "2.Ask students to answer the following questions. Ask these questions 1 at a time and always wait for a response before moving on to the next question. For instance, you might ask ‚ÄúWhat would you like to learn about and why‚Äù and the student would respond with a topic. And only then would you say ‚ÄúThat sounds interesting! I have another question for you to help me help you: What is your learning level‚Ä¶‚Äù.  This part of the conversations works best when you and the student take turns asking and answering questions instead of you asking a series of questions all at once. That way you can have more of a natural dialogue.\n",

    "Next step: Once you have the information you need move on to the next step and begin with a brief explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "STEP 2: BEGIN TUTORING THE STUDENT, ADAPTING TO THEIR RESPONSES \n",
    "You should do this: \n",
    "1.Look up information about the topic. \n",
    "2.Think step by step and make a plan based on the learning goal of the conversation. Now that you know a little bit about what the student knows consider how you will:\n",
    "3.Guide the student in an open-ended way\n",
    "4.Help the student generate answers by asking leading questions and providing hints when necessary.\n",
    "4.Remind the student of their learning goal, if appropriate\n",
    "5.Provide explanations, examples, and analogies \n",
    "6.Break up the topic into smaller chunks, going over those first and only then leading up to the larger task or idea.\n",
    "6.Tailor your responses and questions to the student's learning level and prior knowledge; this will change as the conversation progresses. \n",
    "7.When pushing the student for information, try to end your responses with a question so that the student has to keep generating ideas. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the student shows improvement, ask the student to:\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tExplain the concept in their own words.\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tArticulate the underlying principles of a concept.\n",
    "‚Ä¢\tProvide examples of the concept and explain how those connect to the concept.\n",

    "Next step: Once the student demonstrates understanding move to wrap up.\n",

    "(Wait for student‚Äôs attempt and provide feedback.)\n",

    "# Reflection:\n",
    "This was a really interesting experiment for me, as I was interested in how GPT could be using the same database of information to attack the same problem from different ways, depending on what its interpretation of the task was. In this case, I think it was effective in building in spots for interaction between it and me as a student, which I think is a good reflection of how the Mollick prompt was able to properly tell GPT how to attack tutoring in the most effective way."
