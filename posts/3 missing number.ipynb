    "Following down the rabbit hole niche of having AI create logic problems for me, I wanted to move away from just logical problems and see if it would be able to tackle quantitative problems as well. Thus, I repeated my prompting to get GPT to give me a numerical pattern problem, and again put it through different AI models to see if it would be able to solve them.\n",

    "Compared to the logic problem, I found that this mathematical equation somehow was so much easier for humans, because we don't neccesarily process information bit by bit, compared to the LLM which literally generates its output building on each last letter. As such, I was interested to also dig deeper into the different thought processes the models would use."

    "This was my second time using AI to tackle a logic-based challenge, but this time I shifted my focus to a numerical question instead of a purely logical one. Once again, I was amazed by the AI's ability to uncover the underlying patterns in the problem and reach the same conclusion I did. Its quick ability for recognizing structure and efficiently following logical sequences was really clear, sparking my curiosity about how AI processes various types of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I find especially intriguing is the difference between AIâ€™s strengths and weaknesses. While it excelled in this more complex, structured task, we've also observed it struggling with simpler problems, like counting the number of â€˜râ€™s in the word â€œstrawberry\" as we spoke about earlier this semester. This disparity raises interesting questions about how AI interprets information and where its limitations might be. It seems that AI thrives when it operates within a clearly defined framework, particularly when dealing with numerical or pattern-based reasoning. However, it tends to fail and struggle with tasks that require more flexible cognitive skills, such as  interpretation, contextual understanding, or  ambiguities in language."
